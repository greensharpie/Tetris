### **_Description_**

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game. The goal is to drop blocks, called tetrominos, down into a playing board to make horizontal lines. There are seven different types of tetrominos. Levels have a set number of lines to clear. When the goal number of lines are clearned the player moves to the next level. As levels go up, the tetrominos fall faster.
